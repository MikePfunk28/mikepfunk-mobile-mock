## Visual Representation

### What Actually Happened (CORRECT ✅)

```
Before PR #35:
                   test branch
                   ↓
    main ─────○───┬──○  (696b59f)
              ↑   │
         (39efe1c)│
                  │
    PR #35 opens: "Merge test INTO main"

After PR #35 merged:
                   
    main ─────○───┴──○──●  (f7da03d) ← Merge commit on main
              ↑         ↑
         (39efe1c)   (merged from test)
```

### What You Were Worried About (DID NOT HAPPEN ❌)

```
If you had merged main INTO test (wrong direction):

    test ─────○───┴──○──●  ← Merge commit would be on test
              ↑         ↑
         (test)    (merged from main)
    
    main ─────○───────────  ← Main unchanged
```

## Historical Pattern

Your git history shows consistent correct usage:
- **PR #35**: test → main ✅ (the one analyzed here)
- **PR #29**: test → main ✅
- **PR #28**: test → main ✅
- **PR #15**: test → main ✅
- **PR #13**: test → main ✅

## How to Verify Merge Direction

For future reference, here are three ways to verify merge direction:

### Method 1: Check the Pull Request
- **Base branch** = destination (where changes go TO)
- **Head branch** = source (where changes come FROM)

### Method 2: Examine the Merge Commit
```bash
git show <merge-commit-sha> --format=fuller --no-patch
```
- First parent = the branch you were ON
- Second parent = the branch you merged FROM

### Method 3: Check Branch History
```bash
git log --oneline <branch> -5
```
The branch that contains the merge commit is the one that received the changes.

## Conclusion

✅ **PR #35 correctly merged test → main**  
❌ **You did NOT merge main → test**  
🎉 **No corrective action needed - everything is working as intended!**

Your workflow is correct, and the changes from the test branch have been successfully integrated into main.
